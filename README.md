I tried to create a modern and simple design that not only displays my frontend development skills and competencies, but also intrigues visitors. On the home page of my business card site, I presented my skills and work experience in a concise way and gave a description of who I am and what I do. My business card site also includes a portfolio of projects in which I have been involved. For each project, I've given a brief description and link so visitors can see what projects I've developed and in what areas.

To ensure easy communication, I've also included links to my social media profiles so people can follow my work and contact me if they want to.
All in all, my business card site not only showcases my professional accomplishments in frontend development, but also provides a convenient way for potential employers and clients to contact me.
