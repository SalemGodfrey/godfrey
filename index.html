                    <p class="slidesText">As an indie game developer, I am passionate about creating unique and engaging
                        gaming experiences. With the freedom to experiment and explore different ideas, I enjoy pushing
                        boundaries and creating games that stand out from the crowd. Working independently allows me to
                        maintain creative control and stay true to my vision. While the journey can be challenging, the
                        reward of seeing players enjoy my games makes it all worthwhile.

            <h1 class=" title text-center">ABOUT ME</h1>
             <p class="mainText"><img class="myPhoto" src="images/avatar1.png" alt="">Hello there! My name is 
                Dimitri Eristavi, but many of my friends know me as Salem Godfrey. I am a
                passionate and dedicated frontend developer with expertise in various programming languages and
                technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular, WordPress, PHP, and MySQL.
<br><br>
                I am a graduate of the ITVET Informational Technologies Academy with a specialization in frontend
                development and web design. Prior to my career in web development, I worked as a technical specialist
                for a well-known advertisement company. My time in the company provided me with invaluable experience in
                handling large-scale web projects, and honed my technical skills to better cater to the needs of my
                clients.
<br><br>
                Aside from my professional pursuits, I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged and fulfilled.
                One of my greatest passions is music, and I am an avid listener of various genres from classical to
                electronic. I am also a game development enthusiast, and I find great joy in creating games that are not
                only entertaining, but also engaging and meaningful. Additionally, I enjoy watching movies of different
                genres, particularly those that are thought-provoking and inspire creativity.
<br><br>
                I have also developed a keen eye for design and aesthetics, and I work proficiently with Illustrator and
                Photoshop. I believe that a visually stunning website can make all the difference in engaging and
                retaining visitors, and I strive to create websites that are both visually appealing and functionally
                robust.
<br><br>
                I am based in the beautiful city of Tbilisi, Georgia, and I am fluent in English with a ะก1 level
                proficiency, as well as Russian with a C2 level proficiency. I am also proficient in my native language
                Georgian, at an B1 level.
<br><br>
                My ultimate goal is to create high-quality websites that are both aesthetically pleasing and
                functionally effective, and I am constantly seeking ways to improve and stay ahead of the curve in the
                rapidly changing world of web development.
